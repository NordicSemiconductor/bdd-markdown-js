# A feature with code blocks that have blank linkes at the end

## Background

Given a codeblock with a blank line at the end

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 12

```

And this should be a separate code block

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 12

Hello World!
```
