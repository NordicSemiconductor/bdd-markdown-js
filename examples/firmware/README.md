This is a sample project that describes features of a firmware, which can be
observed (in parts) from the debug log the firmware generates when running.

It is included because it demonstrates the use of the `Context`, which is a
global object available to provide run-time settings to the test run, which
replace placeholders in step titles and codeblocks.
