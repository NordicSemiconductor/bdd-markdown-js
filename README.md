# BDD Markdown

Write BDD tests in Markdown.

## Idea

Writing BDD tests should be more comfortable
[than this](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/cloud-e2e-bdd-test-runner-example-js/blob/ca4f6e8c517c13f1c88abfdb6426c8ed6fe730e7/features/Webhook.feature),
so why not use Markdown? It could look [like this](./features/Goal.md).

- it is a well supported document format, many tools like auto-formatters
  already exist
- it provide good tools to structure a hierarchical document
- it has support for embedding source code / JSON payloads, and even tables
